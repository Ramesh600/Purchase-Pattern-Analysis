# 🛒 Purchase Pattern Analysis Using Apriori Algorithm

Market Basket Analysis for Combo Offer Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
Retailers often struggle to identify profitable product combinations without data-backed evidence.  
This project applies the **Apriori Algorithm** to transactional retail data to uncover frequent itemsets and strong association rules that support combo offers and cross-selling strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify frequently bought-together products
- Generate strong association rules using support, confidence, and lift
- Recommend optimal combo offers
- Visualize insights using Power BI

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** – Data cleaning & aggregation  
- **Python** – Data processing & Apriori algorithm  
- **Apriori Algorithm** – Association rule mining  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard & visual insights  

## 📊 Dataset
Transactional retail data containing:
- Transaction ID  
- Product Name  
- Quantity  
- Price  
- Date  
- Country  

> Note: Original dataset is not shared due to confidentiality. Sample data structure is provided.

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and validation using SQL  
2. Transaction-level basket formation  
3. Binary matrix conversion  
4. Apriori algorithm execution  
5. Rule filtering using support, confidence & lift  

## 📈 Key Results
- Average Lift: **3.2x**
- Confidence Rate: **~85%**
- Identified **Top 5 frequently bought-together product pairs**
- Generated **12+ actionable association rules**

## 💡 Business Impact
- Data-driven combo offer design  
- Improved cross-selling strategies  
- Increased average basket value
